# Blockchain Concepts

## What is Blockchain?

- At simplest, no more than a distributed database. 
- Imagine a large worldwide comptuer where everyone can securly data and execute transactional code. 
- All transactions are stored in blocks of data. Very hard to manipulate or fake, once stored on blockchain.
- Ultimately provides a trustworthy way to store data in scenarios where there is no trust.
- - Examples:
- - - Monetary transactions between strangers
- - - Store medical information accessible only by certain individuals
- Not a place to store large amounts of data for each transaction (i.e. Not for images, but better for validation data for images to dissuade tampering)
- Most data focuses on transactions and states of objects rather than the objects themselves.

## Bitcoins = Blockchain?

- Bitcoin, first broadly used cryptocurrency
- Cryptocurrency only exists as a digital currency, and holds no underlying value
- A Bitcoin is at its simplest a unique string of letters and numbers attached to an owner.
- Very similar to the US Dollar after gold standard was done away with; you trust the bank to keep a secure ledger of incoming and outgoing values.
- No central system with Bitcoin, with no way to revert transactions.
- Bitcoin cannot exist without blockcain

### History of Blockchain
- 1991: Cryptographic secured chain of blocks describned by Stuart Haber and Scott Stornetta
- 1998: Decentralized digital currency by Nick Szabo
- 2008: Blockchain Concept
- 2009: Satoshi Nakamoto invents Bitcoin; no one knows who Satoshi is.
- 2014: Mainstream term in financial and technical media
- 2017: Race is on to work on blockchain development

### Characteristics of Blockchain
 - Global Singleton
 - - Natively object-oriented (code and data reside togehter)
 - - Objects are securely separated from each other
 - Unstoppable
 - - Cannot be stopped and cannot have a central failure
 - - No single point of attack or plug to pull
 - Accessible
 - Anyone with an Internet connection can access the blockchain through a number of means.
 - Verifiable
 - - Everyone with access to a blockchain can verify everything on a blockchain.
